# Azure-Sentinel-Showcase
I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. I'll observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. I will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on an Azure Sentinel Map!
